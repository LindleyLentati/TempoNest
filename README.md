TempoNest
=========

Bayesian analysis tool for pulsar timing.

TempoNest provides a means of performing a joint Bayesian analysis of the deterministic pulsar timing model, 
and the stochastic signals present in the time of arrivals (TOAs).  

It uses the Bayesian inference tool MultiNest (available at http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/ ) 
to explore the joint parameter space, 
whilst using Tempo2 as a means of evaluating the timing model (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tempo2/).

For more details on the included functionality, as well as installation and useage instructions, 
please refer to the included manual (TempoNestManual.pdf).
